# Kotlin Showcase

This project demonstrates the most important features and functions of the Kotlin programming language.

## Features Demonstrated

1. **Null Safety** - Kotlin's approach to handling null values safely
2. **Extension Functions** - Adding methods to existing classes without inheritance
3. **Data Classes** - Classes designed to hold data with autogenerated functions
4. **Functional Programming** - Lambdas, higher-order functions, and collection operations
5. **Smart Casts** - Type checking and automatic casting
6. **Object Expressions and Declarations** - Anonymous objects and singletons
7. **Property Delegation** - Delegating property behavior to other objects
8. **Scope Functions** - Functions that execute a block in the context of an object
9. **Coroutines** - Kotlin's approach to asynchronous programming

## Running the Project

Ensure you have JDK 11+ and Gradle installed, then run:

```bash
cd demo
gradle run
```

## Code Structure

The project is contained in a single file `KotlinShowcase.kt` that demonstrates all the key features of Kotlin in a structured way. Each feature is demonstrated in its own function, making it easy to understand and explore.

## Learning from this Project

To learn Kotlin effectively using this project:

1. Start by reading through the code from top to bottom
2. Run the project to see the output of each function
3. Experiment by modifying the examples to understand how they work
4. Use the code as a reference when working on your own Kotlin projects

This showcase is designed to be comprehensive while remaining easy to understand, even for developers new to Kotlin.
